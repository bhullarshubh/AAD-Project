        1) Four matrices M1, M2, M3 and M4 of dimensions pxq, qxr, rxs and sxt respectively can be multiplied is several ways with different number
         of total scalar multiplications. For example, when multiplied as ((M1 X M2) X (M3 X M4)), the total number of multiplications is 
         pqr + rst + prt. When multiplied as (((M1 X M2) X M3) X M4), the total number of scalar multiplications is pqr + prs + pst. 
         If p = 10, q = 100, r = 20, s = 5 and t = 80, then the number of scalar multiplications needed is
        
        A) 248000
        B) 44000
        C) 19000
        D) 25000

            Correct answer is C. It is a standard problem of dynamic programming.

        2) The subset-sum problem is defined as follows. Given a set of n positive integers, S = {a1 ,a2 ,a3 ,…,an} and positive integer W, is 
        there a subset of S whose elements sum to W? A dynamic program for solving this problem uses a 2-dimensional Boolean array X, with n 
        rows and W+1 columns. X[i, j],1 <= i <= n, 0 <= j <= W, is TRUE if and only if there is a subset of {a1 ,a2 ,...,ai} whose elements sum 
        to j. Which of the following is valid for 2 <= i <= n and ai <= j <= W?
        
        A) X[i, j] = X[i - 1, j] ∨ X[i, j -ai]
        B) X[i, j] = X[i - 1, j] ∨ X[i - 1, j - ai]
        C) X[i, j] = X[i - 1, j] ∧ X[i, j - ai]
        D) X[i, j] = X[i - 1, j] ∧ X[i -1, j - ai]

            Correct answwr is B. X[I, j] (2 <= i <= n and ai <= j <= W), is true if any of the following is true:
            1) Sum of weights excluding ai is equal to j, i.e., if X[i-1, j] is true.
            2) Sum of weights including ai is equal to j, i.e., if X[i-1, j-ai] is true so that we get (j – ai) + ai as j.

        3) Consider the following table:
        <img src="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/3-6.jpg">
        The task is to pick a subset of these items such that their total weight is no more than 11 Kgs and their total value is maximized. 
        Moreover, no item may be split. The total value of items picked by an optimal algorithm is denoted by Vopt. A greedy algorithm sorts the 
        items by their value-to-weight ratios in descending order and packs them greedily, starting from the first item in the ordered list. The 
        total value of items picked by the greedy algorithm is denoted by Vgreedy. The value of Vopt − Vgreedy is?
        
        A) 16
        B) 20
        C) 24
        D) 32

            Correct answer is A. This is really famous DP problem known as KNAPSACK.
            This is classic question to explain difference between greedy and dynamic programming. The optimized algorithm of
            this question is through DP. Think about it.

        4) Consider the following two sequences :
        X = < B, C, D, C, A, B, C >, and 
        Y = < C, A, D, B, C, B > 
        The length of longest common subsequence of X and Y is :

        A) 4
        B) 3
        C) 5
        D) 2

        <pre>
            Correct answer is A. This is again really famous application of DP: Longest increaasing subsequence.
