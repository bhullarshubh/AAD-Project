    <h1>Bitwise algorithms</h1>
    <p>Bitwise Algorithms are Algorithms used to perform operations at bit-level or to manipulate bits in different ways. The bitwise operations are found to be much faster and are some times used to improve the efficiency of a program.</p>
    <p>Bit manipulation is defined as performing some basic operations on bit level of n number of digits. It is a speedy and primitive method as it directly works at the machine end.</p>
    <p>For example: To check if a number is even or odd. This can be easily done by using Bitwise-AND(&) operator. If the last bit of the operator is set than it is ODD otherwise it is EVEN. Therefore, if num & 1 not equals to zero than num is ODD otherwise it is EVEN.<br>

        Operations with bits are used in Data compression (data is compressed by converting it from one representation to another, to reduce the space). In order to encode, decode or compress files we have to extract the data at bit level. Bitwise Operations are faster and closer to the system and sometimes optimize the program to a good level.</p>
        <p>Also Check 4th question in level 5, how bitwise operation makes it in linear time which would have taken logarithmic time.</p>
        <p><strong>There are six types of the bitwise operator in Java:</strong></p>

          <p> 1) Bitwise AND<br>
            2) Bitwise exclusive OR<br>
            3) Bitwise inclusive OR<br>
            4) Bitwise Compliment<br>
            5) Bit Shift Operators(Right and Left Shift)</p>
