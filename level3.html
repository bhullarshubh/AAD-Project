    <h3>Greedy algorithm</h3>
    <h4>Read the tutorial first if you are not confident in this topic and then solve this level.</h4>
    <pre>
        Greedy algorithm is a general calss which contains many algorithm. Few important algorithms are tested at this level such as:
        1) Activity selection problem
        2) Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree 
        3) Huffman coding
        4) Dijkstra shortest path
    </pre>
    <h5>Questions</h5>
    <pre>
        1) Suppose we run Dijkstra’s single source shortest-path algorithm on the following edge weighted directed graph with vertex P as the 
           source. In what order do the nodes get included into the set of vertices for which the shortest path distances are finalized?

        2) Suppose the letters a, b, c, d, e, f have probabilities 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/32 respectively. Which of the following is the 
           Huffman code for the letter a, b, c, d, e, f?
        
        A) 0, 10, 110, 1110, 11110, 11111
        B) 11, 10, 011, 010, 001, 000
        C) 11, 10, 01, 001, 0001, 0000
        D) 110, 100, 010, 000, 001, 111

        3) Using Prim's algorithm to construct a minimum spanning tree starting with node A, which one of the following sequences of edges represents 
        a possible order in which the edges would be added to construct the minimum spanning tree?
        <img src="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gq/2015/12/primsMST.png">

        A) (E, G), (C, F), (F, G), (A, D), (A, B), (A, C)
        B) (A, D), (A, B), (A, C), (C, F), (G, E), (F, G)
        C) (A, B), (A, D), (D, F), (F, G), (G, E), (F, C)
        D) (A, D), (A, B), (D, F), (F, C), (F, G), (G, E)

    <div id="dropdown3" style="display:none">
    <pre>
        Correct answer is D.
        A and B are False : The idea behind Prim’s algorithm is to construct a spanning tree, means all vertices must be connected but here 
        vertices are disconnected.

        C is False : Prim's is a greedy algorithm and At every step, it considers all the edges that connect the two sets, and picks the minimum 
        weight edge from these edges. In this option weight of AB < AD so must be picked up first.

        D is True : It represents a possible order in which the edges would be added to construct the minimum spanning tree. Prim’s algorithm is 
        also a Greedy algorithm. It starts with an empty spanning tree. The idea is to maintain two sets of vertices. The first set contains the 
        vertices already included in the MST, the other set contains the vertices not yet included. At every step, it considers all the edges that 
        connect the two sets, and picks the minimum weight edge from these edges. After picking the edge, it moves the other endpoint of the edge 
        to the set containing MST.

        4) A text is made up of the characters a, b, c, d, e each occurring with the probability 0.11, 0.40, 0.16, 0.09 and 0.24 respectively. 
           The optimal Huffman coding technique will have the average length of:
        
        A) 2.40
        B) 2.16
        C) 2.26
        D) 2.15

        <pre>
            Correct answer is B.
            Hint : lenghth for each character = no of bits * frequency of occurence.
