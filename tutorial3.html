    <h1>Greedy algorithm</h1>
    <p>In this method, we have to find out the best method/option out of many present ways.</p>
    <p>In this approach/method we focus on the first stage and decide the output, don't think about the future.</p>
    <p>This method may or may not give the best output.</p>
    <p>Greedy Algorithm solves problems by making the best choice that seems best at the particular moment. Many optimization problems can be determined using a greedy algorithm. Some issues have no efficient solution, but a greedy algorithm may provide a solution that is close to optimal. A greedy algorithm works if a problem exhibits the following two properties:</p>
    <p>1) Greedy Choice Property: A globally optimal solution can be reached at by creating a locally optimal solution. In other words, an optimal solution can be obtained by creating "greedy" choices.<br>
        2) Optimal substructure: Optimal solutions contain optimal subsolutions. In other words, answers to subproblems of an optimal solution are optimal.</p>
    <p> Various problems under greedy algorithm and their study links are given below:</p>

    <p>Greedy has following 3 characterstics:</p>
    <p>1) Feasible: Here we check whether it satisfies all possible constraints or not, to obtain at least one solution to our problems.<br>
        2) Local Optimal Choice: In this, the choice should be the optimum which is selected from the currently available<br>
        3) Unalterable: Once the decision is made, at any subsequence step that option is not altered.</p>
