    <h4>Read the tutorial first if you are not confident in this topic and then solve this level.</h4>
    <pre>
        1) What is the return value of following function for arr[] = {9, 12, 2, 11, 2, 2, 10, 9, 12, 10, 9, 11, 2} and n is size of this array.
        int fun(int arr[], int n)
        {
            int x = arr[0];
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
                x = x ^ arr[i];
            return x;
        }

        A) 9
        B) 0
        C) 2
        D) 10
    </pre>
    <button onclick="ShowDiv1()" width="100" height="30">SHOW</button>
    <button onclick="HideDiv1()" width="100" height="30">HIDE</button>
    <div id="dropdown1" style="display:none">
    <pre>
        Correct answer is A. This is very common use of XOR used in various questions.
        Note that 9 is the only element with odd occurrences, all other elements have even occurrences. If the input array has all elements with 
        even occurrences except one, then the function returns the only element with odd occurrences. Note that XORing an element with itself 
        results 0 and XOR of 0 with a number x is equal to x.

        2) What does the following C expression do? x = (x<<1) + x + (x>>1);
            
        A) Multiplies an integer with 7
        B) Multiplies an integer with 3.5
        C) Multiplies an integer with 2
        D) Multiplies an integer with 9
    </pre>
    <button onclick="ShowDiv2()" width="100" height="30">SHOW</button>
    <button onclick="HideDiv2()" width="100" height="30">HIDE</button>
    <div id="dropdown2" style="display:none">
    <pre>
        Correct answer is B.
        This question is to enable you to under right and left shift through multiplication and division.
    </pre>
    </div>
    <pre>
        3) What does the following C expression do?
            x = x & (x-1)

        A) Sets all bits as 1
        B) Makes x equals to 0
        C) Turns off the rightmost set bit
        D) Turns off the leftmost set bit
    </pre>
    <button onclick="ShowDiv3()" width="100" height="30">SHOW</button>
    <button onclick="HideDiv3()" width="100" height="30">HIDE</button>
    <div id="dropdown3" style="display:none">
    <pre>
        Correct answer is C. 
        Take 2 cases, rightmost bit of x is 1 and in other case its 0. You will get answer.
        1/0 & 0 = 0 ; 1 & 1 = 1
    </pre>
    </div>
    <pre>
        4) What does following function do?
        bool function (unsigned int x) 
        { 
            return (!(x&(x-1))); 
        }
    </pre>
    <button onclick="ShowDiv4()" width="100" height="30">SHOW</button>
    <button onclick="HideDiv4()" width="100" height="30">HIDE</button>
    <div id="dropdown4" style="display:none">
    <pre>
        This function determines whether x is function of 2 or not(except 0). Refer previous question for this.
        PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS FUNCTION IS O(1) BECAUSE WE USED BITWISE OPERATION. THAT IS THE CLEAR ADVANTAGE OF BITWISE ALGOS OVER OTHER AS 
        THEY DRASTICALLY DECREASE COMPLEXITY OF OUR SOLUTION.
